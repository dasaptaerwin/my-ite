	 - Synopsis: 
		 - How did India and Indonesia set up preprint repositories? Motivations, challenges and how to overcome them and advice to others who may be interested in pursuing a similar direction. How did France build communities of researchers reviewing and recommending for free preprints in their fields in an open, independent, non-exclusive and reliable way, managed by researchers and for researchers? How are researchers empowered to regain control of scholarly publishing refocusing on articles and not the journals quality? How do research performing and research funding institutions support this process? And how inclusiveness and equity is ensured in this process?
